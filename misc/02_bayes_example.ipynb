    "**Induction**: Evidence to hypothesis; generalising from observation.  Example of an inductive argument: \"All ravens I have seen are black. Therefore ravens are black.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deduction**: Hypothesis to conclusion; applying what is known. Example of a deductive argument: \"All noble gasses are stable. Neon is a noble gas. Therefore neon is stable.\" Multiple hypotheses may be generated (by induction), and their conclusions checked against the facts; \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth\" (Sherlock Holmes).\n",
